# Indian-Tax-Calculation-System

Problem Statement
In February 2025, the Indian government revised the personal income tax structure to provide relief to taxpayers and stimulate economic growth. The new tax regime, applicable for the Financial Year (FY) 2025-26 (Assessment Year 2026-27), introduced updated tax slabs and increased the basic exemption limit. As a result, individuals with an annual income up to ₹1.2 million (₹12,00,000) are exempt from paying income tax. For incomes exceeding this threshold, tax rates are applied progressively based on specified slabs.

Objective: Develop a Python program that calculates the income tax payable based on the revised tax slabs for FY 2025-26.  

Example Calculation:

For a gross annual income of ₹18,00,000:

Gross Income: ₹18,00,000
Standard Deduction: ₹75,000

Net Taxable Income: ₹18,00,000 - ₹75,000 = ₹17,25,000
Tax Calculation:

First ₹4,00,000: 0% of ₹4,00,000 = ₹0

Next ₹4,00,000 (₹4,00,001 to ₹8,00,000): 5% of ₹4,00,000 = ₹20,000

Next ₹4,00,000 (₹8,00,001 to ₹12,00,000): 10% of ₹4,00,000 = ₹40,000

Next ₹4,00,000 (₹12,00,001 to ₹16,00,000): 15% of ₹4,00,000 = ₹60,000

Remaining ₹1,25,000 (₹16,00,001 to ₹17,25,000): 20% of ₹1,25,000 = ₹25,000

Total Tax Liability: ₹0 + ₹20,000 + ₹40,000 + ₹60,000 + ₹25,000 = ₹1,45,000
